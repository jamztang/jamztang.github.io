Hi, I'm Jamz Tang, an iOS & UX Engineer. I recently quited my full-time job and become a freelancer.
<s>@mystcolor</s> **@jamztang** is now my main online identity.

What I am recently into
----

Since 2013 I came across GTD and Pomodoro Techinque. I followed thesecretweapon.org and derived my own Evernote system to combind the two techiques. I noticed I was still missing a real simple count down app on my Macbook Air. I couldn't find any in the AppStore that suits my needs so I decided to implement my own [PomodoroApp][3].

Few years ago I found [ioscodesnippet.com][1] to keep track of reusable iOS snippets.
I was hoping to make some money out of the site, which didn't work out. 
I recently revamped and introduced the support for CocoaPods and removed all
the ads. The new site (and also this) is made with a static site generator called _Jekyll_ and
hosted directly on _GitHub Pages_.

In one of my recent [hackathon][] experience, I learnt about a web based
prototyping tool called Flinto. In coincidence of the _Hong Kong
Government denial of free-tv licence to HKTV_, I made this [HKTVApp][]
prototype using Flinto and Keynotopia to show my support and belief in
online media.

iOS and UX Design Experience
----

I've a lot of thoughts on iOS development. I started my career almost 4
years ago. At my first company, I was very lucky to be the
main developer of [Labelbox][] and [Chaopin][].

We have several mobile photography based product. I noticed when remote
photos were first displayed on the device, it would caused a tiny lag. I struggled
to fix the problem for all our apps, and I managed to find the solution.
It was the first time I made contributions to a very popular third party [opensource project][rs/SDWebImage].

Then I joined my second company as UX Designer, without previous designing track
records. I tried working pretty hard to become a good designer, that was the
time I picked up wireframing tools I didn't use before like _Adobe Fireworks_
and _Keynotopia_.

My role has also changed at several points. At the ninth month point I
was advanced to become iOS team lead, and about the same period later the
company agreed my request to become a part-time employee. With the new
schedule I was able to start reworking on my own projects and also work
as a freelancer.

What am I looking for
-----

I am practicing to sustain as a freelancer and work more remotely.
I hope I would be able to get physically free, so that to travel around
the world in the next year, yet able to continue sustain and continue
my career.

I am also trying out to run this blog differently than a traditional news comes
first ordering. Life should be like chapters of stories, and that's why you're
seeing these long paragraphs here. If you read this far I hope you are finding
it enjoyable and interesting instead.

If you think it's interesting you can find more about me at the navigation panel.
