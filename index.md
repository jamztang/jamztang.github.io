Hi, I'm Jamz Tang, an iOS & UX Engineer. I recently quit my full-time job and started my freelance working life style.

Since 2013 I came across GTD and Pomodoro Techinque. I derived my own Evernote system from thesecretweapon.org, then I noticed I still missed a real simple count down app on the mac. I couldn't find one suites me on the AppStore so I decided to implement my own [PomodoroApp][3].

I enjoy a free-er life and working modal, targeted to read one book per week, and looking forward to travel around the world in the next year.

I now use ~~@mystcolor~~ @jamztang as my main online identity.
