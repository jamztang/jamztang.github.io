Hi, I'm Jamz Tang, an iOS & UX Engineer. I recently quited my full-time job and become a freelancer.

Since 2013 I came across GTD and Pomodoro Techinque. I followed thesecretweapon.org and derived my own Evernote system to combind the two techiques. I noticed I was still missing a real simple count down app on my Macbook Air. I couldn't find any in the AppStore that suits my needs so I decided to implement my own [PomodoroApp][3].

I enjoy a free-er life and working model, target to read one book per week, and looking forwards to travelling around the world in the next year.

I now use ~~@mystcolor~~ @jamztang as my main online identity.
