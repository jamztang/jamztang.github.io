I'm Jamz Tang, an iOS & UX Engineer. I recently quit my full-time job and started my freelance working career.

Since 2013 I've been practicing [GTD][1] and [Pomodoro technique][2]. I couldn't find a simple enough mac app so I wrote my own [PomodoroApp][3], and implemented my own todo system using Evernote.

I'm working towards a free-er life, reading personal development and travel-the-world books.

I now use ~~@mystcolor~~ @jamztang as my main online identity.
